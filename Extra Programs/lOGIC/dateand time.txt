Python code to current date and time code

from datetime import datetime
now = datetime.now()
            # Format the date and time with AM/PM
            dott = now.strftime('%d/%b/%Y %I:%M:%S %p')



To capture the current date and time with AM or PM in Python, you can use the datetime module. Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to do this:

python
Copy code
from datetime import datetime

# Capture the current date and time
now = datetime.now()

# Format the date and time with AM/PM
current_time = now.strftime('%d/%b/%Y %I:%M:%S %p')

# Use the variable as needed
nt = request.form.get('acn', '').strip()
print(current_time)  # Example output: "15/Aug/2024 04:28:45 PM"
In this code:

%d: Day of the month as a zero-padded decimal number.
%b: Abbreviated month name.
%Y: Year with century as a decimal number.
%I: Hour (12-hour clock) as a zero-padded decimal number.
%M: Minute as a zero-padded decimal number.
%S: Second as a zero-padded decimal number.
%p: AM or PM.
You can use the current_time variable anywhere in your Flask application just like you would with nt.
