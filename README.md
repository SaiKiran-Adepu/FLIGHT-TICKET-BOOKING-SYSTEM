The Application is mainly based on the IRCTC Flights web application here passengers can allowed to book a reservation ticket while login in the application 
to achieve this i am used Technologies front end Html, CSS, JS Backend Python Flask, and Database MYSQL
in this project there are 3 main modules  
1. Airline Admin: the Admin of the web application can login to the application with Admin Privileges, after the successful login to the application admin can register a new Airlines(Airplanes) that which are operating from Origin to Destination ex New Delhi to New York for this i am used an API that retrieve automatic Airports that registered with the project which will restricts the duplicates of data inserts into DB table and admin can book a ticket he can check all the details of the reservation like reservation done by PNR number seat number payment mode etc
here if any error that occurs while booking a ticket it automatically returns back to the first page which will reduce the server load
